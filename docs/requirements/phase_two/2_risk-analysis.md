# *RAD* Risk Analysis Improvements Phase 2

This section adds risk analysis parts to apply everything learned during the workshop.

## `risk.intensity`: 

- **Parents:** ["goal.kill-cancer"]

If radiation intensity of the *RAD* is too high, patients may get seriously injured or may even die.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25.

To prevent this, the *RAD* must limit the radiation intensity to stay below a safe threshold.

**Note:** For a real product you'd set a specific threshold value here.
